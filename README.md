# VEHICLE-PLATE-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM-USING-MATLAB
VPR is an image processing system that extracts and recognizes license plate numbers to identify vehicles and details. Capture image, pre-processing, plate region extraction, character segmentation in the extracted number plate, character recognition, database comparison, and result indication are the portions of the algorithm. It is a fast, efficient method for detecting car number plates that work well on complicated photos. This strategy can be employed in a variety of settings, including parking lots, toll booths, and traffic signals
